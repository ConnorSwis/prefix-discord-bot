# Prefix Discord Bot
A basic template bot for individual command prefixes.

Change the values in the [`.env`](./.env) file to run this program on your own bot.

This was created using [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) and [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html).

Feel free to use any code for whatever you'd like!
